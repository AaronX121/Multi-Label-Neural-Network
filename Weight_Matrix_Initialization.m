function [Weight_Matrix] = Weight_Matrix_Initialization(Network_Structure)
%   This function is used to initialize weight matrixes between layers
% according to the struct of network structure. All matrixes are stored in
% a cell array (Weight_Matrix). Following operations on updating link
% weights are also processed in this cell array.
